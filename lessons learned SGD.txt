	24.7 Delegate
		someDelegate += someVariable => SomeFunction();
		-that someVariable is used idk why
		common practice: name that variable "_"
		
	25.7. "Call-me-each-frame" vs "Call-me-once" methods:
		It's important to distinguish methods, which only
		need to be called once to finish their role, vs.
		methods which need to be called each frame to move
		towards a goal.
		
		I usually call the "call-me-once" methods 
		"StartX" and the "call-me-each-frame" methods 
		"MoveTowardsX" 
		
	26.7. 2D Universal Render Pipeline project setup
		After having created a standard 2D project, import 
		the Universal Render Pipeline (URP) package from  
		package manager.
		Afterwards, right click in explorer > create >
		rendering > universal render pipeline > 
		pipeline asset (forward renderer).
		This step will also automatically create a pipeline
		asset render (or something like that, idk). For 2D
		purposes, delete this additional asset and instead 
		do right click > create > rendering > universal 
		render pipeline > 2D renderer. 
		Drag the 2D renderer into the pipeline asset's 
		general > renderer list.
		Also, don't forget: quality > HDR (checkmark this)
		Finally, go to edit > project settings > graphics >
		and drag the pipeline asset into the scriptable 
		render pipeline asset field at the very top.
		
	26.7. Shadergraph sprite outline shader bug
		In the lessonslearned folder > Images, find the 
		"Shadergraph_visual_bug.png". It shows that even 
		though in the scene view, a shader may look bugged,
		it is actually correclty rendered in the game view,
		so no worries.
		
	30.7. HTML tags in text
		Want to make a letter in your UI text component 
		coloured? You can do:
		I am<color=blue>very</color>happy
		Don't forget to tick rich text
		
	3.8. Why won't my 2D character rig?
		TL;DR: rename from .psd to .psb. Or did you forget 
			to apply a Sprite Skin component?ľ
		
		Sooo, you've imported a .psd, want to rig it but 
		there seem to be no separate layers? Well that's 
		because the psd importer slices a .psd into mutliple
		ready-to-rig&skin sprites when the file extension 
		is .psb ("photoshop large file format or something, 
		idk").
		
	3.8. One-way platforms
		Use the Platform Effector 2D and for the collider 
		which is supposed to be one-way-only, don't forget to 
		check isUsedByEffector
		
	4.8. Remove a specific instance of a class in a list:
		Iterate the list via a for-loop and if 
		ReferenceEquals(desiredObject, list[iii])
		is true, list.RemoveAt(iii)
		
	5.8. Array length & null
		When you have an array with the length 0, it's not 
		null!!! Same goes for all the other 
		collection-types.
		
	5.8. Cast Vector3 to Vector2
		vect3 = (Vector2) someVector3;
		
	11.8. The transform rotation in the inspector may be 
		different to that output by 
		Debug.Log(transform.localRotation.eulerAngles).
		As a rule of thumb, always rely on the Debug.Log 
		value. The inspector is just for human readability,
		but is NOT reliable for code purposes
		
	12.8. Rotating when a rigidbody component is applied
	
		If it's a rigidbody2D, rotate around the Z axis 
		using rigidbody2D.rotation!!!
		
		Setting the rotation via transform will produce
		unexpected physics results
		
	12.8. LateUpdate
		Gets called once every script's Update method has
		been called. Useful for camera movement for example.
		
	13.8. Out keyword enforces the change of a parameter in a function
		(I'm sure there's a better way to do this but for now, this is 
		all I know. Maybe the same intent can be better achieved with 
		interfaces, I heard..)
	
		Say you're making a fade in n out script.
		You have an "opaque -> black" part of the script and a 
		"black -> opaque" part.
		What if once the screen goes completely dark, you'd like to 
		invoke some delegate and only after all of its content is done 
		executing, start the "black -> opaque" transition?
		
		Well, you could have a public bool canFadeOut, which if is true, 
		would allow the "black -> opaque" transition. But how do we 
		enforce that in the delegate, canFadeOut WILL be updated?
		
		Enter: the out keyword! The out keyword works exactly like a 
		pointer. But if you have a delegate with an out param, and 
		subscribe a method with an out param to this delegate, the 
		compiler will throw an error if you don't modify the out 
		param, which got passed into this method.
		So all you have to do is:
		
			//in fade script: 
			public void outDlg(out bool b);
			public outDlg onFadeMiddle;
			
			public bool canFadeOut=false;
			
			private void Update() {
				//go to completely dark
				
				if (completelyDark) {onFadeMiddle?.Invoke(out canFadeOut);}
				
				if (canFadeOut) //go to completely opaque
			}
			
			//-------------------------------------------------------------
			//in another script:
			fadeScript.onFadeMiddle = StuffToDoWhileScrBlack;
			
			private void StuffToDoWhileScrBlack(bool out finished) {
				//do something and once its done, set finished to true
				finished = true;
			}
			
	14.7. Constructor called even for arrays visible in the inspector
	
		Picture this: 
		
		public class GravityObject {
			private Vector3 originalPosition;
			
			public GravityObject() {
				originalPosition = transfrom.position;
			}
		}
		
		Now, I have an array of GravityObjects serialized in the inspector.
		It's interesting to see that even when I populate the array in the 
		inspector, the constructor for every GravityOject in this array 
		gets called.
		
	18.8 Sprite shape is all one texture :(
		Say you have a grass and a dirt texture. If you want the dirt 
		texture to appear on the side of a cliff and have the sprite shape 
		profile already set up, do this (unintuitive) thing:
		
		On the edges of your grass, set the curve to that "V" shape type 
		in the 3-type-picker-boxes
		
	19.8 'Using' keyword
		It can be used as a statement to automatically dispose of an object
		once it's out of the enclosing code block. It's conceptually the 
		same as the with .. as .. statement in Python
		
		using (var someObj = new someObject()) {
			//do stuff with the object
		}
		//someObj will have been cleaned up after at this point
		
	19.8 casting
	somewhere in code:
	
	target as GlowControl; //the as keyword casts target as a GlowControl. same as doing (GlowControl)target
	
	I think.
	
	20.8. Reversing animations
		
		In this example, I'll use a vignette animation. It goes from no 
		vignette at all to completely black. I want the animation to start 
		playing once two certain objects farther away, than is 'maxDist'.
		Once they re-enter the 'maxDist' range, reverse the animation.
		
		//first, set up the animation transitions in the Animator inspector 
		//window like so:
		
			[Entry]       [Vignette_Animation]
			   V
			   V		//note that there is no transition between Entry and Vignette_Animation
			   V
		 [Empty State]
		 
		//Don't forget to untick Vignette_Animation's Loop Time
		//next, In the animator create a float parameter called "Speed".
		//After having done this, for the Vignette_Animation state, give the "speed" field 
		//a multiplier and set it to "Speed", so that we can change it in code. 
		//(Yeah this is a bit confusing, refer to the image "Reverse_Animation_Setup", in 
		//the images folder)
		 
		//next, take a loot at this code, the explanation will be given afterwards, or 
		//read the TL;DR
		//TL;DR: normalizedTime keeps always increasing/decreasing behind the scenes 
		//and you can't set vignetteAnim.speed directly >.<
		
		Animator vignetteAnim;
		int animationLayer=0;
		
		private void Start() {
			vignetteAnim = GetComponent<Animator>();
			vignetteAnim.PlayInFixedTime("Vignette_Animation", animationLayer);
		}

		private void Update() {
			if (isFartherThanMaxDist && vignetteAnim.GetCurrentAnimatorStateInfo(animationLayer).normalizedTime <= 1f)
			{  
				vignetteAnim.SetFloat("Speed", 1f);     
			}
			else if (!isFartherThanMaxDist && vignetteAnim.GetCurrentAnimatorStateInfo(animationLayer).normalizedTime >= 0f) {
				vignetteAnim.SetFloat("Speed", -1f);
			}
			else {
				vignetteAnim.SetFloat("Speed", 0f);
			}
		}
		
		//In Start(), we play the animation on layer 0. We do this not only because it doesn't 
		//get played by default, but also so that we can get information about this animation 
		//using GetCurrentAnimatorStateInfo(0) - the 0 is the layer parameter.
		
		//GetCurrentAnimatorStateInfo(animationLayer) returns an object containing various info about 
		//that layer's currently played animation. We're interested in normalizedTime.
		//normalized time is actually made up of the animation's normalized time + the number of 
		//loops completed. So 6.5 means we played 6 full loops and are in the middle of the 7th one, even 
		//though the animation is not looping. (It is looping, but you can't see it. The displayed frame 
		// is stuck on that animation's last frame, but normalizedTime continues increasing/decreasing.)
		
		//Anyway, consider this example:
		//if the Loop Time checkbox is unticked, normalizedTime is 3.5 and we decide to 
		//reverse playback time, the animation won't start actually reversing until 2.5 loops pass.
		//This is the reason why we only allow the Speed float to be anything other than 0 only if 
		//normalized time is in range (0-1)
		
		//Also, we reverse the animation NOT by setting vignetteAnim.speed, but rather the "Speed"
		//float parameter which acts as a multiplier for vignetteAnim.speed. 
		//Setting vignetteAnim.speed = -1 doesn't reverse the animation, it merely just stops it, for 
		//some annoying reason. But if you do it using the "multiplier-method", it works somehow :p
		
		20.8. Particle Effect Editor window 
			You can toggle that annoying window with start lifetime and stuff.
			Refer to 
			Images > "Particle_Effect_Window.png"
		
		22.8. UI Image radial fill.
			UI Images have a fill type property in the inspector. One of those properties allows for 
			a radial fill of the sprite :os
			
		22.8 Use bool TryGetComponent(out component)
		
		22.8. Searching in the Editor
			The hierarchy, scene, console and project windows all have a search bar, where 
			you can look up specific objects, assets, debug logs, etc
			
		22.8. Wanna freeze both the rotation and position on only ONE axis or a rigidbody?
			rb.constraints = RigidbodyConstraints2D.FreezePositionX | RigidbodyConstraints2D.FreezeRotation;
			
			It's a bitwise OR operation. It works cause RigidBodyConstraints are bitmasks.
			
		22.8. There is a way to restore your project after a crash. Google it. 
			TL;DR 
				DO NOT OPEN UNITY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
				Overwrite some file first
	
	
		23.8. Select object on cursor position
			Imagine that you're clicking on a box in the scene view and it won't get 
			selected. That's because multiple objects may be overlapping it, such as 
			the canvas, background, etc. 
			
			All you need to do is click multiple times. While clicking continuously, 
			Unity will cycle through all gameobjects that are overlapping the mouse cursor.
			
		23.8. When changing a prefab but you only want to change, say, one value:
			Change it and then right click > apply to prefab. 
		
		24.8. Formatting text in UI Text
