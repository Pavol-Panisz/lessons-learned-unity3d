	17.01.21 set entire project to a specific commit:
	
		Get the SHA of the commit, to which you want to 
		revert. This can be done in the Github desktop app
		by right clicking on a commit and selecting 
		Copy SHA. Then, open the repository in the 
		command prompt (It's one of the options on top
		of the app taskbar) and type:
		
		git reset f7823ab --hard
		
	    f7823ab is the SHA of the commit you want to reset 
		to. From my experience, it can be much longer such as
		
		eb4b4c9c4b66f418eda713b9ad64a5929ea9584b
		
		the --hard instruction means, that no changes from 
		what you've done to the code since the desired commit 
		will be kept. You're completely travelling back in time.
