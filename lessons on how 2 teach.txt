How 2 teach the Unity editor basics:
	-Start by BRIEFLY explaining what all the windows do,
		so that people aren't overwhelmed.
	-Explain things by creating a problem and then
		showing the solution. For example:
		I want to have this sprite behind this sprite 
		at all times, but currently, it's not this way.
		"For such cases, use sorting layers".
		Or
		So I drew this sprite and I want it to be exactly
		one unit wide. It is made of 16x32 pixels.
		"For such cases, set pixels per unit to 16 - so 
		there will be 16 pixels in one unit"
	-Make sure the mouse is ultra visible. The 
		default mouse on PCs is really tiny and not
		at all visible on a larger screen, for example
		when doing a presentation in front of an audience.
