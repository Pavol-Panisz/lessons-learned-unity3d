	24.7 Delegate
		someDelegate += someVariable => SomeFunction();
		-that someVariable is used idk why
		common practice: name that variable "_"
		
	25.7. "Call-me-each-frame" vs "Call-me-once" methods:
		It's important to distinguish methods, which only
		need to be called once to finish their role, vs.
		methods which need to be called each frame to move
		towards a goal.
		
		I usually call the "call-me-once" methods 
		"StartX" and the "call-me-each-frame" methods 
		"MoveTowardsX" 
		
	26.7. 2D Universal Render Pipeline project setup
		After having created a standard 2D project, import 
		the Universal Render Pipeline (URP) package from  
		package manager.
		Afterwards, right click in explorer > create >
		rendering > universal render pipeline > 
		pipeline asset (forward renderer).
		This step will also automatically create a pipeline
		asset render (or something like that, idk). For 2D
		purposes, delete this additional asset and instead 
		do right click > create > rendering > universal 
		render pipeline > 2D renderer. 
		Drag the 2D renderer into the pipeline asset's 
		general > renderer list.
		Finally, go to edit > project settings > graphics >
		and drag the pipeline asset into the scriptable 
		render pipeline asset field at the very top.
		
	26.7. Shadergraph sprite outline shader bug
		In the lessonslearned folder > Images, find the 
		"Shadergraph_visual_bug.png". It shows that even 
		though in the scene view, a shader may look bugged,
		it is actually correclty rendered in the game view,
		so no worries.
		
	30.7. HTML tags in text
		Want to make a letter in your UI text component 
		coloured? You can do:
		I am<color=blue>very</color>happy
		Don't forget to tick rich text
